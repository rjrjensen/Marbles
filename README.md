# Marbles
This is the digital adaptation of the beloved **Marbles** game that was created by the Lindaman family (or someone they know) and tortures the McGregor family (and everyone they know). That game is actually an adaptation of the **Aggravation** board game, but since the Case family are born *cheaters*, they changed all the rules.

## The Game (Physical)
### The Board
The physical game is played on a wooden square with divots carved into the top surface in the following pattern:

```
 1              o  o  o  o  2              2 
    1           o     2     o           2    
       1        o     2     o        2       
          1     o     2     o     2          
                o     2     o                
 1  o  o  o  o  o           o  o  o  o  o  o 
 o                                         o 
 o  1  1  1  1        o        3  3  3  3  o 
 o                                         o 
 o  o  o  o  o  o           o  o  o  o  o  3 
                o     4     o                
          4     o     4     o     3          
       4        o     4     o        3       
    4           o     4     o           3    
 4              4  o  o  o  o              3 
```

Each of the diagonal rows of four are the home rows, one for each player, and this is where all the marbles start. Once I figure out how to add color to these README files, I'll show the colors for each players spaces instead of numbers. For now, you can reference this photo of an Aggravation board:

From each home row, each marble starts in the space to the right of the row in the corner and moves *forward* in a clockwise direction around the board. Two spaces to the right (or counterclockwise) of the start space is where the marble turns into their respective finish row. All of these spaces are color-coded (as shown on the photo).

### The Cards
The Lindamans decided to use a deck of cards for each player instead of a communal pair of die. Each card has a different value and some have special attributes.

| Card | Number of spaces | Special attributes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ace  | 1 | Place a marble on the start space, take another turn |
| Two  | 2 |  |
| Three  | 3 |  |
| Four  | 4 | You must move back four spaces |
| Five  | 5 |  |
| Six  | 6 | Place a marble on the start space, take another turn |
| Seven  | 7 | You can split the seven moves between two marbles |
| Eight | 8 |  |
| Nine  | 9 |  |
| Ten  | 10 |  |
| Jack  | 1 | You can swap any two marbles on the board, take another turn |
| Queen  | 1 | Place a marble on the start space, take another turn |
| King  | 1 | Take another turn |

`Rules are subject to change, of course. (Cameron, looking at you)`

## How to play
### Setup
Each player places all of their marbles in their home row and grabs a deck of cards. After shuffling the deck of cards, each player cuts the deck and shows the card in the middle of the deck. The player with the highest card (Ace is the high) goes first and the turns go clockwise around the board.

### Players turn
Once a starting player is determined, he/she draws a card off the top of their deck. Referencing The Cards table above, the player makes a move. If a move cannot be made, the next turn commences. If the player drew a card with a "Take another turn" attribute, then the player draws again. 

Each player continues this pattern, moving their marbles strategically around the board.

### The goal
The goal for each player is to get all of his or her own marbles into the finish lane. If the game is played with teams, the goal is to get all of the marbles for each player on the team in their respective finish lanes. Once one of the teammates completes their finish lane, their drawn cards from then on can be used to move their partner's marbles.

The first player or team to get all of the marbles in the finish lane is declared the ****winner****.
